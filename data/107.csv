1067,107,Chemistry,How many electrons are there in a helium atom?,2,1,3,4,1,"A helium atom is an atom of the chemical element helium. Helium is composed of two electrons bound by the electromagnetic force to a nucleus containing two protons along with either one or two neutrons,depending on the isotope,held together by the strong force."
1068,107,Chemistry,In D and L forms of lactic acid D is positive or negative rotation?,Negative rotation,Positive rotation,,,2,"Lactic acid is chiral consisting of two optical isomers. One is known as L-(+)-lactic acid or (S)-lactic acid and the other,its mirror image,is D-(−)-lactic acid or (R)-lactic acid. A mixture of the two in equal amounts is called DL-lactic acid."
1069,107,Chemistry,Which conformation of cyclohexane is more stable?,Half chair conformation,Boat conformation,Chair conformation,Twist boat conformation,3,"Cyclohexane have chair,boat,twist-boat conformations. Among these chair conformation is the most stable conformation of cyclohexane bechause it has no angle strain and axial and equitorial protons are in alternative arrangements."
1070,107,Chemistry,How many neutrons are present in oxygen atom?,12,14,16,8,4,Oxygen is the 8th element in the periodic table. This means that Oxygen has 8 protons and 8 electrons. In order to get the number of neutrons you take the atomic weight in this case 15.9999~16 and you subtract it by the number of protons (16-8=8).
